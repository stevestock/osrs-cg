# osrs-cg
A practice tool, replicating part of Corrupted Gauntlet fight in OldSchoolRuneScape.

## How to use
1. Visit https://stevestock.github.io/osrs-cg/
2. Swap between inventory and prayer book with 1 / 2 keys.
3. Move by clicking on the board. Attack by clicking on white hunlleff area.
4. For both Player and Hunleff, attack style is displayed on the bottom, and prayer is displayed on the top.

### Advanced use
After making a copy of the page, config variable can be edited to tweak the behavior.

## Current limitations:
1. Hunleff never uses prayer-disabling attack.
2. No support for augment prayers.
3. Limited sound cues. Using Hunllef Helper is recommended.
4. Only last Hunllef stage is simulated.
5. Hunleff stomp doesn't delay its next attack.
6. No easy way to edit config other than changing the page content.
7. Damage numbers are rough estimates and likely don't match reality well.
